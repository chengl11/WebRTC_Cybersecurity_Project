**Project Name:** WebRTC & Cybersecurity Project

### Description (Continuously update)

This project is to develop a Google Extension call "WebRTC Notifier". When a user opens a new website, if the site is using WebRTC, a window will pop up to indicate that the user is currently using WebRTC. Users can choose to ban WebRTC from the site or to quit the site.

## Technology Selection
[Tech.md](https://github.com/chengl11/WebRTC_Cybersecurity_Project/blob/master/tech.md) includes technology selection part of our project. We analyzed different ways to detect the usage of WebRTC and the feasibility of these possible solutions. We worked on this both in sprint 2 and sprint 3.

## Goal for Sprint 5
1. add details to the pop-up window. Alert users to the risk of WebRTC leakage. Like giving away their real IPs.
2. Add another option for user to open our extension. Now, our extension has to be opened by clicking the icon. We will add a new option. If the user selects this option, our plug-in will automatically run in the background when they open a new browser, which means opening another new TAB automatically.
3. Add block feature to block WebRTC on the current website if time allowed.
