### Description (Continuously update)

This project is to develop a Google Extension call "WebRTC Notifier". When a user opens a new website, if the site is using WebRTC, a window will pop up to indicate that the user is currently using WebRTC. Users can choose to ban WebRTC from the site or to quit the site.

## Technology Selection
[Tech.md](https://github.com/chengl11/WebRTC_Cybersecurity_Project/blob/master/tech.md) includes technology selection part of our project. We analyzed different ways to detect the usage of WebRTC and the feasibility of these possible solutions. We worked on this both in sprint 2 and sprint 3.
